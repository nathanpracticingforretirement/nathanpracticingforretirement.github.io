The last thing I want to give you is an excuse to TLDR this post. So, I am quickly summarizing my adventures up until the present. The plan for the future is to make posts giving details to past events along with updating y’all on current happenings.</p>
<p>At twenty-four years of age, I have spent the last year and a half taking full advantage of the freedom bestowed upon me after finishing my eighteen year stint in the American education system. Graduating university marked the end of committed obligations and for the first time gave me the freedom to choose exactly what to do with my time, not only for short term but also long term. With this freedom I have chosen a path where I feel like I have more in common with an old retired person than an average office jockey my age. (With the catch of having significantly less money and significantly less financial security.)</p>
<p>Since February, 2020 I have been in travel mode. First exploring Taiwan and Thailand, where I found myself sitting helplessly as the toilet paper crisis swept across America and the panic associated with the virus went viral. Luckily, I managed to make it back to the States in April, where I spent months exploring the absolute behemoth of a country by car and bicycle, gaining some new perspectives and understandings of the eccentricities of the United States.</p>
<p>In March of 2021, I drove 60 hours in six days across the country from Sacramento to Miami with all my belongings packed into the back seat of my 01 Camry, sleeping squished in the backseat along the way. I spent three months reconnecting with childhood friends, learning to sail, and scouring craigslist daily trying to convince my parents how good an idea buying and living on a sailboat was. If you&rsquo;re dreaming, why not dream big.</p>
<p>In the end, I stayed on land and drove north making stops in Atlanta (highlight of old crazy man in Walmart coming soon) and at a free campsite lakeside in Tennessee, where an impromptu plan was made to make my way to New York and celebrate Annabelle graduating from high school. We had an incredible time exploring the city with our stomachs. Continuing north, I fulfilled a two year old promise that I’d come see the Mainelanders. So I lived the Peaks island life while spending time with the twins and Aunt Carla (who I have been meaning to tell that I tried making the vegan chocolate cake we made in Switzerland and somehow made semi burnt, chewy, lightly chocolated dough) ooooof.</p>
<p>In July, after reminiscing the horror and stress of getting stuck internationally, I decided to risk it again and make the hop across the Atlantic on a direct flight to Madrid. I spent a couple weeks exploring Spain where I finally learned it’s not grassyass but graThias. Similarly, I once again learned how much of a skill traveling in a foreign country is. Every interaction, even the most basic, requires overcoming fears and putting yourself out there to be judged. I never thought my armpits would start leaking so heavily from something as simple as a Spanish grocery store cashier trying her absolute best to teach me how to buy fruit in Europe. For those wondering, you weigh and get a barcode BEFORE checking out.</p>
<p>Currently, I am staying with an old teammate from my collegiate volleyball days in Switzerland living my best European summer unfortunately without a beach speedo yet. More to come soon!</p>
<p>Life’s for living people!</p>
